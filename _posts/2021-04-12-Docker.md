# What is Docker?

It is a virtualisation of hardware to run containerised applications with all dependencies packaged in it!

I will elaborate that in English, soon!

# Commands

I will update this soon!

# Anecdotal Usages
## Removing multiple docker images
type ``docker ps -a --format '{{.Names}}`` to get all the names of the docker images.
Put that in this code and run the python script, to get the command to paste onto the bash terminal, replacing the names to wahtever you get above.

```python
names=["funny_dhawan",
"festive_ardinghelli",
"distracted_driscoll",
"dreamy_antonelli",
"fervent_ramanujan",
"eager_chatterjee",
"affectionate_hamilton",
"priceless_lumiere",
"condescending_elion",
"hopeful_dijkstra",
"gallant_carver",
"keen_swirles",
"admiring_mclean",
"sad_brahmagupta",
"exciting_franklin",
"loving_mccarthy",
"agitated_noether",
"unruffled_turing",
"inspiring_williamson",
"naughty_shannon",
"wonderful_volhard"]

import numpy as np
text=[]
for name in names:
	text.append(f"docker rm {name}&& \n")
text=np.asarray(text)
for it in text
	print(it)
```


## Making this website!

Working with jekyll is sort of fun and interesting, but getting ruby and gems installed on my computer isn't. Docker came to the rescue and long story short, by running

```python
docker run --rm -it --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD/vendor/bundle:/usr/local/bundle" --env JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll build
```

to pull the docker image if it isn't installed, I was ale to build the base website locally.

This was then followed by a simple

```bash
docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD/vendor/bundle:/usr/local/bundle" --env JEKYLL_ENV=development -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve
```

to serve up the site locally! Now I can make changes and see the effects immediately, rather than wait for Github to load changes.

Now I don't have to be bothered about umpteen dependencies being installed or be surprised when it works on a Tuesday, but not on a Wednesday!
