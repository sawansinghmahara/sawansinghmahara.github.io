# What is Docker?

It is a software platform that was released on *20 March 2013*. This platform allows you to create container processes, which are simply processes that have all the required dependencies packaged in itself. It doesn't use the host system's packages to run.

This allows one to run things in isolation and minimise dependency issues and package conflicts that occur when you develop software. Docker runs all these processes run on the linux kernel as root. It is present on other operating systems as well, but it is best suited for the linux kernel, in my opinion.

This concept isn't new however, so what makes docker different, in my opinion is

* It is open source
* It has been created really well and is easier to understand and use than the alternatives
* It is documented well

For more information, I suggest you look into other [blogs](https://devopscube.com/what-is-docker/) or [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo) to get a better understanding.

# Commands

## Basics

1. `docker run <image name>`

   * This is a simple way of running an image to create a container. It will do something only if the docker image that you are pulling is made to do something when run like this (usually not the case)

   * A more useful way of doing this would be something like 

     ```bash
     docker run -it -v $PWD:/my_folder_in_container -w /my_folder_in_container --rm --name <customname> <image name>
     ```

     This is a long command, let's break it down and understand the arguments. More of them can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) if you want a better explanation or other use cases.

     * `-it` ensures that you run in interactive mode, opening a bash shell for you to play around inside the container.
     * `-v` will allow the directory current host's working directory `$PWD`  to be mounted onto the folder `/my_folder_in_container`, as given by the example above.
     * `-w` Will create a directory named `/my_folder_in_container` inside the root directory of the container.
     * `--rm` Will delete the container once the container is exited (either manually from the bash terminal or if the command that was to be executed on startup is done running)
     * `--name` will allow you to put your own name `<customname>` instead of making docker do that for you automatically, for the image `<image name>` that you are making the container of.

   * If the container isn't locally present, it will try and fetch it from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/), by default.

2. `docker pull <image name>`

   * This command pulls the docker image `<image name>`

3. `docker start <customname>`

   * This starts a docker container with the name `<customname>`.

4. `docker ps`

   * Shows all running containers
   * `docker ps -a`
     * Shows all containers that are present in your system, even the ones not running.
     * This can be used to get the name of a container and start it up with the command mentioned in point `3` above.

5. `docker kill <customname>`

   * This kills a running container of the name `<customname>`

6. `docker exec -it <customname> bash`

   * Once an image has been created and is running, this command allows you to re-enter it via a bash shell.
   * All changes that you make inside the container stays inside it.
   * You can replace bash with anything else like ``docker exec <customname> python /mycode.py` and it will execute the python script `mycode.py` if it is present inside the container's root directory. This is not in interactive mode, so upon execution, the container will be exited.

7. `docker login`

   * Lets you login to your [dockerhub account](https://hub.docker.com/) from where you can push, pull containers and images in your account, among other things.

8. `docker commit <customname> smellingsalt/<new_image_name>:latest`

   * Once you have logged in, this command allows you to commit all changes to the container `<customname>` and save it to an image named `<new_image_name>` with a tag `latest`, to the user `smellingsalt`.

9. `docker push smellingsalt/<new_image_name>:latest`

   * This will push the docker image `smellingsalt/<new_image_name>` to the dockerhub account `smellingsalt` with a tag `latest`

10. The next things would be working with dockerfiles, which will be updated soon!



# Anecdotal Usages
## Removing Selected Docker Containers

Type the following

```bash
{% raw %} docker ps -a --format {{.Names}} > names.txt {% endraw %}
```

to get all the names of the docker images, stored in the text file `names.txt`.
* Add, delete or keep all the entries in the text file the same.
* The following code deletes all the containers whose names are present in `name.txt`, and then deletes it.

```python
import os
with open('names.txt') as fp:
    for line in fp:
        os.system(f"docker rm {line}")
os.system("rm names.txt")
```

## Making this website!

Working with jekyll is sort of fun and interesting, but getting ruby and gems installed on my computer isn't. Docker came to the rescue and long story short, by running

```python
docker run --rm -it --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD/vendor/bundle:/usr/local/bundle" --env JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll build
```

to pull the jekyll docker image if it isn't installed, I was able to build the base website locally.

This was then followed by a simple

```bash
docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD/vendor/bundle:/usr/local/bundle" --env JEKYLL_ENV=development -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve
```

to serve up the site locally! Now I can make changes and see the effects immediately, rather than wait for Github to load changes.

As a bonus, I don't have to be bothered about umpteen dependencies being installed or be surprised when it works on a Tuesday, but not on a Wednesday!
