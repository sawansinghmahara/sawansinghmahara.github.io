# What is Docker?

It is a virtualisation of hardware to run containerised applications with all dependencies packaged in it!

I will elaborate that in English, soon!

# Commands

I will update this soon!

# Anecdotal Usages

## Making this website!

Working with jekyll is sort of fun and interesting, but getting ruby and gems installed on my computer isn't. Docker came to the rescue and long story short, by running

```python
docker run --rm -it --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD/vendor/bundle:/usr/local/bundle" --env JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll build
```

to pull the docker image if it isn't installed, I was ale to build the base website locally.

This was then followed by a simple

```bash
docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD/vendor/bundle:/usr/local/bundle" --env JEKYLL_ENV=development -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve
```

to serve up the site locally! Now I can make changes and see the effects immediately, rather than wait for Github to load changes.

Now I don't have to be bothered about umpteen dependencies being installed or be surprised when it works on a Tuesday, but not on a Wednesday!
