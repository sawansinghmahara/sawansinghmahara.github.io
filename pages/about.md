I am a currently a Master's researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology - Dharwad. Bangalore is my home since 1996!

# Some Things About Me
<strong>_A well defined problem is half solved._</strong> Defining a problem clearly has lead to solutions being apparent or has made the task of breaking it down into easier chunks, straightforward. With this being paramount to the way it works, the structure, rigor and soundness of mathematics enamored me. Once I was exposed to seeing how seemingly insurmountable problems can be solved, I was hooked! In essence if I encounter a problem, I try and reformulate what is happening again and again, until it is as clear as it can be! Sometimes it leads me to ask a lot of questions, which sometimes annoys the impatient (and only them, I hope).

Another aspect about me is that I do not deal in absolutes. I have not watched star wars, so the whole *"only a Sith deals in absolutes"*  line will be met with an accommodative smile. This however does not mean that I'd prefer saying "I will most likely have dinner tonight at 20:30" over "I will have my dinner at 20:30 tonight", it just means that I try to factor in as many possibilities as I can, while making decisions!

# Some Other Things About Me
As a child I enjoyed breaking apart things to understand how they work. That urge for better or for worse, hasn't left me yet! As an adult fortunately, that has been supplemented with the ability and patience to put those things back together again.

There are at least 2 more things about me than the ones I have mentioned here I could go on about for a bit, but I suppose this should be enough for now!
