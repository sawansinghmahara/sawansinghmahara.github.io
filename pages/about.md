# Who am I? What is this website?
Hello, I'm a wireless communications engineer with experience in both academic and professional settings. I started my journey as a Bachelor's student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at PESIT Bangalore South Campus, where I honed my technical skills and discovered my love for machine learning.

During my Master's studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad, I went deeper into the field of Distributed Machine Learning, with a specific focus on Federated Learning. This research allowed me to explore disciplines such as reinforcement learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

Currently, I work at NXP Semiconductors, where I apply my expertise in wireless communications to the automotive infotainment industry. Specifically, I design and optimize channel decoders for the DRM subsystem, working with a team of experts to develop innovative solutions that meet project requirements and deadlines.

My technical skills include implementing machine learning algorithms in Python and Linux, and I have a strong foundation in probability theory, statistical pattern recognition, linear algebra, and convex optimization. I'm also proficient in using Docker, BASH and Nvidia NGC tools, to name a few, to deliver efficient and effective solutions.

I believe in clear communication and a collaborative approach to work, which is why I work closely with my team members to achieve our goals. As someone who values continuous learning, I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in my field, and sometimes outside it. I'm excited to explore new challenges and opportunities in the future.

When I'm not busy with work, you can find me on the basketball court, hitting the gym, or pursuing my hobbies. I have a passion for photography, and I love capturing the beauty of the world around us. I'm also an avid biker and enjoy exploring new trails and scenic routes.

Life is all about balance, and I believe in finding the perfect mix of work, play, and passion.


# Some Things About Me
<strong>A well-defined problem is half solved._</strong>  By breaking down complex issues into manageable parts, I can approach problem-solving with clarity and precision. This approach is rooted in my background in mathematics, which has taught me the value of clear and rigorous thinking.

In decision-making, I avoid making absolute statements. While I haven't watched Star Wars, I appreciate the quote "only a Sith deals in absolutes" and recognize the importance of considering multiple possibilities when making decisions. This however does not mean that I'd prefer saying "I will most likely have dinner tonight at 20:30" over "I will have my dinner at 20:30 tonight", it just means that I try to factor in as many possibilities as I can, while making decisions, keeping room for all possibilities! Bayesian thinking is most likely an apt summary of this, probably.

Since childhood, I have enjoyed taking things apart to understand how they work. This curiosity has stayed with me as an adult, and I now have the patience and expertise to reassemble things properly.

There are additional aspects of my personality that I could discuss, but the constraints of this format prevent me from doing so.
