# Who am I?
I am a currently a Master's researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology - Dharwad. My home is in Bangalore where I have been living in since 1996!

# Research Philosophies
<strong>_A well defined problem is half solved._</strong> Defining a problem clearly has lead to solutions being apparent or has made the task of breaking it down into easier chunks, straightforward. With this being paramount to the way it works, the structure, rigour and soundness of mathematics enamoured me. The chaos of uncertainty being reined in by probability showed me that same maths in action, which lead me to look at the bedlam in the field of machine learning from a different perspective. What does it mean for anyone or anything to learn? Why is generalisation so hard? Why can a young child look at just a single picture of a dog and be able to tell it apart from a bird? Although these questions might flummox even the giants in the field, they show that a lot is still yet to be uncovered. As an engineer, our job of optimising and making things work in places they normally wouldn't found me interested in Federated Learning, but from a slightly pragmatic perspective.
