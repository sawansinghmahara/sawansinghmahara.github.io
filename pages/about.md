# Who am I?
I am a currently a Master's researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology - Dharwad. I did my Bachelor's in Engineering at PESIT Bangalore South Campus, in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I currently am researching the field of Distributed Machine Learning, which looks into machine learning across a network of devices! 

I have been in Bangalore for around 24 of my life and currently am in Dharwad, completing my Master's Degree.

# Some Things About Me
<strong>_A well defined problem is half solved._</strong> Defining a problem clearly has lead to solutions being apparent, or it has made the task of breaking it down into easier chunks, straightforward. This kind of an approach to solve problems is all thanks to my exposure to mathematics. In essence if I encounter a problem, I try and reformulate what is happening again and again, until it is as clear as it can be! I enjoy a fair amount of mathematical rigour in work, as that gives proper insights into them!

Another aspect about me is that I do not deal in absolutes. I have not watched star wars, so the whole *"only a Sith deals in absolutes"*  line will be met with an accommodative smile. This however does not mean that I'd prefer saying "I will most likely have dinner tonight at 20:30" over "I will have my dinner at 20:30 tonight", it just means that I try to factor in as many possibilities as I can, while making decisions!

As a child I enjoyed breaking apart things to understand how they work. That urge for better or for worse, hasn't left me yet! As an adult fortunately, that has been supplemented with the ability and patience to put those things back together again.

There are at least 2 more things about me than the ones that I have mentioned here. I could go on about them, but the margins of this blog are too narrow to contain any more.
