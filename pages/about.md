# Who am I? What is this website?
I am a currently a Master's Student at the Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad. I did my Bachelor's in Engineering at PESIT Bangalore South Campus, in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am currently researching the field of Distributed Machine Learning, Federated Learning to be precise, which looks into machine learning across a network of devices! 
I am interested in disciplines of the likes of reinforcement learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. As these are ever evolving fields, there is always something new to learn about learning to learn, which I enjoy doing!

The objective of this website is to showcase a bit more about the various things I am interested in and how that changes and evolves over time. It also serves as a pubic notebook of sorts from where I can refer to some information that I deem useful.

# Some Things About Me
<strong>_A well defined problem is half solved._</strong> Defining a problem clearly has lead to solutions being apparent, or it has made the task of breaking it down into easier chunks, straightforward. This kind of an approach to solve problems is all thanks to my exposure to mathematics. In essence if I encounter a problem, I try and reformulate what is happening again and again, until it is as clear as it can be! I enjoy a fair amount of mathematical rigour in work, as that gives proper insights into them!

Another aspect about me is that I do not deal in absolutes. I have not watched star wars, so the whole *"only a Sith deals in absolutes"*  line will be met with an accommodative smile. This however does not mean that I'd prefer saying "I will most likely have dinner tonight at 20:30" over "I will have my dinner at 20:30 tonight", it just means that I try to factor in as many possibilities as I can, while making decisions!

As a child I enjoyed breaking apart things to understand how they work. That urge for better or for worse, hasn't left me yet! As an adult fortunately, that has been supplemented with the ability and patience to put those things back together again.

There are at least 2 more things about me than the ones that I have mentioned here. I could go on about them, but the margins of this blog are too narrow to contain any more.
