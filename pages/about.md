# Who am I? What is this website?
Hey there, I'm a wireless communications engineer with a passion for machine learning, NLP, distributed systems and mathematics. I'd be delighted to share my journey with you.

My adventure started back in 2014 when I joined PESIT Bangalore South Campus to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. It was a great time for me to discover and hone my technical skills and also discovered my love for machine learning.

In 2019, I continued my academic journey by pursuing a Master's degree in Wireless Communications Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad. This was a significant turning point in my life, where I delved deeper into Distributed Machine Learning and Federated Learning in a Wireless Communication setting. During my time there, I got to explore various disciplines such as natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and many more.

Fast forward to 2023, I'm currently working at NXP Semiconductors, where I apply my expertise in wireless communications to the automotive infotainment industry. Here, I design and optimize channel decoders for the DRM subsystem. I work with a team of experts to develop innovative solutions that meet project requirements and deadlines. Being a part of this team has allowed me to apply my expertise in wireless communication to a practical setting, and it has been amazing to experience the impact of my work in the real world.

As an engineer, I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I believe that by constantly learning and growing, we can make a difference in the world. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to put my skills to the test.

When I'm not busy with work, you can find me on the basketball court, hitting the gym, or pursuing my hobbies. I have a passion for photography, and I love capturing the beauty of the world around us. I'm also an avid biker and enjoy exploring new trails and scenic routes.

In conclusion, I'm proud of my journey so far and grateful for the experiences that have shaped me into the engineer I am today. I'm excited to see what the future holds and look forward to new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

This website is something of a blog mixed with my current interests and passions. I will be updating it as and when life flows in in its meandering path!


# Some Things About Me
<strong>A well-defined problem is half solved.</strong>  By breaking down complex issues into manageable parts, I can approach problem-solving with clarity and precision. This approach is rooted in my background in mathematics, which has taught me the value of clear and rigorous thinking.

In decision-making, I avoid making absolute statements. While I haven't watched Star Wars, I appreciate the quote "only a Sith deals in absolutes" and recognize the importance of considering multiple possibilities when making decisions. This however does not mean that I'd prefer saying "I will most likely have dinner tonight at 20:30" over "I will have my dinner at 20:30 tonight", it just means that I try to factor in as many possibilities as I can, while making decisions, keeping room for all possibilities! Bayesian thinking is most likely an apt summary of this (probably).

Since childhood, I have enjoyed taking things apart to understand how they work. This curiosity has stayed with me as an adult, and I now have the patience and expertise to reassemble things back properly (most of the times).

There are additional aspects of my personality that I could discuss, but the constraints of this format prevent me from doing so.
