# Federated Learning
When a lot of computing devices are spread across a network and
* each have their own set of data points that they want to classify or cluster
* none of them want to share this data with anyone else
* each alone is incapable of learning a useful neural network

how does one go about solving this issue? An attempt at tackling this issue can be found in  [this blog post here.](/_posts/mtfeel)



Another interesting issue is looking at the mathematical guarantees of privacy that can be ensured in such settings. A blog post about differential privacy will come soon!
