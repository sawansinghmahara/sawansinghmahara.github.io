# Initial Setup

* You can set up an empty project with the command

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject projectname
  ```

  * This creates a folder named `projectname` within which there will be some `.py` files in.

* You can test out the created project and a simple tutorial/documentation page by running a server with the created files. `cd`into the `projectname` folder and run

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

  * This sets up a website that can be accessed in the browser with `localhost:8000`

# Apps

You can create apps by running

```python
python manage.py startapp <appname>
```

## urls.py in an app

This file is by default created in a project, but not in the app. It is used to map urls to different apps and functions.

You can create a custom url for every app. To link an app's url to the main project's url, first create a `urls.py` in the app folder

In this file, add the following line (the first is also present in the default urls.py). The second line imports the `views.py` module, required to render pages.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('',views.home,name="home") #Pointing to the views module, invoke the home function.
    ]
```

## views.py

Here, import the HttpResponse package to allow webpage renderable responses.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World")
```

## Main urls.py in a project

To map the `urls.py` from apps into the main project, thereby granting access to the app via urls in the browser, the following addition needs to be made to the main `urls.py` file.

* Import the `includes` package from `django.urls ` (`from django.urls import include`)

* Use the includes function above to add the path to the app's url in the main `url.py` (`path('',include('firstapp.urls'))`)

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path, include
  
  urlpatterns = [
      path('',include('firstapp.urls'))
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
  ]
  ```

  

# Rendering Templates

First create a folder that holds your webpage html and css, say in a folder called `templates` in the root of your projects directory.

## settings.py

The `TEMPLATES` tag is what renders any webpage. Add the link to the created webpage by adding the line to the `TEMPLATES` variable `'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],`.

```python
import os
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```



## app's view.py

Modify the hello world written [here](#views.py) to now render a page.

```python
def home(request):    return render(request, 'index.html')
```

# Getting inputs from the websites you create

Create a form as shown below. The `function_call ` is the routine to be written in the `urls.py` of the app that will service this request.

```html
<form action="function_call">    <input name="variable"></form>
```

And service the request with something like

```python
def url_check(request):    url=request.GET["url"]    computation= url+str(1)    return render(request,"result.html",{"result":computation})
```
